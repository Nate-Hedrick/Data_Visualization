# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Me and a classmate were thinking of using a Data Visualization on Jupyter Notebook to create a model, for example an economic model, that looks at prices or recession. This will help looking at a bunch of numbers you may not understand. It will put them in some sort of format that is better to understand.
Back up plan me and my classmate want to do is create a program that beats the game 2048 every time it plays.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Jake Creasy

## Do you have any questions of your own?
